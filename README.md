# myPassword

Just a simple password generator and manager.

## Introduction

Every knows about password managers like 1Password, however their closed source
made me slightly concerned about their integrity - will they stealthily send my
password to their servers?

myPassword is a simple, open source password manager that can generate passwords
for you, as well as store them safely with Apple's iCloud Keychain. You can lock
access to your passwords with either a master password, or your Touch ID finger
prints (on supported devices)

You are supposed to review the source code before installing and using this
software. I do provide a free distribution on App Store, however it is suggested
to review the application before compiling and installing it to your own devices
yourself, using your own copy of Xcode whenever possible.

The following devices should work with this application:

*   iPhone 5s and above
*   iPhone SE
*   iPad Air 2 and above

Additionally, the following devices should also work, albeit without Touch ID
functionality:

Among those devices, tests are conducted with the following devices, and is
guaranteed to work:
